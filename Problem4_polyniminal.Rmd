Define the polynomial function described below.

\[
p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x +a_2x^2+ ... + a_nx^n = \sum^n_{i=0} a_i x^i
\]


Show out put when $x=1, 2,..., 10$ when $n=2$ 

In this exercise, all of coefficients is one, except for $a_0 = 11$ but you are supposed to write a general code. In other word, your function has to be used to any $n$ not only for $n=2$.


# Sample Answer


```{r}
pol <- function(x,n){
       s = 11
       for (i in 1:n) {
        s <- x**i + s
       }
       return(s)
      }
```
To get an out put we want to see,


```{r}
for (i in 0:10){
     print(pol(i,2))
 }
```

Every number is prime number. Is this a coincidence?

No. Some formulas (e.g. EUler, Dirichlet, ...) explain the distribution of prime numbers in an arithmetic progression.
